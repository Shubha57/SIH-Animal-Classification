## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Resize, normalize, and augment images for better model training.  
2. **Model Selection:** Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify cattle and buffalo images.  
3. **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
4. **Deployment:** Save the trained model for future predictions.

## Expected Outcome
- High-accuracy classification of cattle and buffalo images.  
- Easy-to-use Python scripts for farmers or veterinarians.  

## Future Enhancements
- Add classification for more animal types.  
- Deploy a mobile or web app for real-time prediction.  
- Integrate with IoT devices for automatic livestock monitoring.
