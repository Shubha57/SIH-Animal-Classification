# SIH-Animal-Classification

## Methodology

**Data Preprocessing:** Resize, normalize, and augment images for better model training.  
**Model Selection:** Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify cattle and buffalo images.  
**Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
**Deployment:** Save the trained model for future predictions.  

## Expected Outcome

- High-accuracy classification of cattle and buffalo images.
- Easy-to-use Python scripts for farmers or veterinarians.

## Future Enhancements

- Add classification for more animal types.
- Deploy a mobile or web app for real-time prediction.
- Integrate with IoT devices for automatic livestock monitoring.
